Notes on Statistical analysis of the inner (good) range of laser data
By jrnatter

On laserReadings1:

I am estimating that the good range of data is from 65 to 145.
The mean of this data is 4.0525 ticks/step/sequence.
The calculated standard deviation is .42114 ticks/step/sequence.

One trial was an obvious outlier; after its removal, the new parameters are as follows:
The mean is 4.037053 ticks/step/sequence.
The calculated standard deviation is .357714 ticks/step/sequence.

Looking at the line graph again, it appears that 10 data points should be cut off from the end of the data.
With the new range being 65 to 135, the new parameters are as follows:
The mean is 4.037454 ticks/step/sequence.
The calculated standard deviation is .369691 ticks/step/sequence.

Because there is a huge dip in the center, trials 100-104 will be cut out. The new parameters are as follows:
The mean is 4.083892 ticks/step/sequence.
The calculated standard deviation is .065154 ticks/step/sequence.


On laserReadings2:

It appears that the only stretch of good data is from points 1-27.
One series was an obvious outlier, so it was removed.
With the cleaned-up data, the new parameters are as follows:
The mean is 4.082315 ticks/step/sequence.
The calculated standard deviation is .072167 ticks/step/sequence.
