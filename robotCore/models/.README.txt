the STL files contain the environment file made by hand and other cad models. 
findAccTransform is a script that can be used to find the transformation from stl file objects (like plates and tools).
the modles of the bread board or any tool should have the first returned value as 4x4 transform to the next frame.
modelRobot however returns the DH parameters of the robot.
