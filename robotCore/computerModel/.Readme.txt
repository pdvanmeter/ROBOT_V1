Strategy:
 1. Get the Staubli-provided cad files into matlab as a triangle mesh.
 2. Simulate any actuation using the DH parameters and the correct pivot for each joint.
  . The correct choice of pivot is obvious from the way the model is divided.
 3. Check every possible pair of triangles for intersection using tri_tri_intersect.
