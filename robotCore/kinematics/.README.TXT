Kinematics can be devided into two parts, Forward and inverse kinematics.

Forward kinematecs takes a set of actuations, Js, and finds the tool or flange 
coordinates in the room frame. 

Inverse kinematics takes the room coordinates with or without an orientation
and returns a set of Js that will produce the desired pose (position and orientation
combination).

There are two ways to do inverse kinematics. 
    
    First is using an anylitic solution.
    This is tricky to find, but the functions that end in Ana use this technique.
    The anylitic solutions return all 8 actuations that bring about the desired pose.
    However often some or all of these are out of the robot's joint space. 
    
    Second is the numeric solution
    When the robot parameters are not perfect and there are slight differences
    due to the calibration of the robot, the anylitic solution will no longer
    yield the correct answer. But it does give a very good initial guess. This 
    can then be fed into the numeric method to achieve the desired solution.
